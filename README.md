This vanilla js app allows you to write small notes, add different background colors and saves them to local storage. I will be adding features and improving (?) this with other things.

## Motivation

Practicing flexbox and starting a project I can expand later on in different ways.

## Use

By clicking on the plus symbol the user can start composing a new note, after which the note is saved by clicking on the arrow button. The newest notes are displayed at the beginning of the list. Notes are saved in local storage, and they can be edited, removed either individually or collectively using the designated buttons.

## Installation

Express is used as server, ```npm i``` .
